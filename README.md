# pokeclicker-super-sync

what if you could play pokeclicker but also someone else could play pokeclicker and you were both playing pokeclicker together?

haha jk.

unless?

currently syncs:
- caught pokemon (including shinies)
- badges

note: this is intended for co-op speedrunning, and only works with new save files. 

## Installation

download the .zip file from the latest releases right over there -->

in firefox, go to "Add-ons and themes" in the menu in the top-right.

click the gear.

select "Install Add-on From File..."

select the .xpi you downloaded from the releases.

theoretically this works on chrome too but i didnt test it.

you may need to disable application signing, as the plugin got disabled by mozilla and they won't tell me why. https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-signing-in-firefox

## Usage

you should see two boxes and two buttons at the bottom of the landing page at https://pokeclicker.com/

everyone who wants to join the session enters their names in the username box. one player hits "Create new session", which populates the online sync code box.

the other players put that code into their online sync code box.

everyone presses "Join Session"

now you're gamin' baby
